--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[11961,0],0] on node node1950
  Remote daemon: [[11961,0],1] on node node1951

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
